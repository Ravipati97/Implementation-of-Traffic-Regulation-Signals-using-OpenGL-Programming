# Implementation-of-Traffic-Regulation-Signals-using-OpenGL-Programming
Project Idea:   The actual idea of this project is to design and implement a traffic signal system that is easily accessible and controlled by the user input i.e. if the signals were to be operated by a person based on the amount of traffic, he/she can use the mouse/keyboard of a computer to regulate the traffic accordingly. The system in this project has been designed in such a way that the vehicles respond to the signal inputs given by the operator and their movement is halted or continued as a result of that operation.    Key Elements in the application: 1. Signals (Red/Yellow/Green) 2. A bus 3. Two Cars, A and B 4. A road with lanes(with vehicles travelling in both directions) 5. A virtual operator(User) 6. Keyboard and Mouse Inputs
